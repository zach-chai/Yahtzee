 * 
 *	- start a new game
 *  - player scores their current dice roll
 *  - round ends, at which point totals are entered for each player
 *  - game ends
 *   
 * These callback functions do no work for you, they only monitor the state of your game. 
 * It is up to you to call the proper function at the proper time with the proper information.
 * The information will be written to an xml file (which you are free to look at), which will 
 * be parsed automatically later to ensure that your implementation functions correctly.
